              Sleep is vital for bodybuilding, as it supports muscle recovery, growth, and overall performance. Hereâ€™s
              why getting enough sleep is essential:
            </p>
            <ol class="jomhuria text-dark fw-bold fs-5">
              <li>
                Muscle Recovery & Growth: Sleep is when your body repairs muscle fibers and builds them stronger. Growth
                hormone is released during deep sleep, aiding muscle recovery and growth.
              </li>
              <li>
                Hormone Balance: Sleep regulates key hormones like testosterone (for muscle building) and cortisol (a
                stress hormone that can break down muscle). Adequate sleep keeps these hormones balanced, optimizing
                muscle growth.
              </li>
              <li>
                Energy & Performance: Sleep restores energy levels, replenishing glycogen stores that fuel muscles
                during workouts. Without enough sleep, energy drops, reducing strength and endurance.
              </li>
              <li>
                Preventing Overtraining & Fatigue: Lack of sleep increases the risk of overtraining and injury. Proper
                rest helps prevent burnout and keeps your nervous system in balance, improving recovery and performance.
              </li>
            </ol>
